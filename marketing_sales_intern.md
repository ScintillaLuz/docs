## About Devcharm

Devcharm has been built by highly skilled technical people for an audience of experts: programmers, web developers and tech geeks of any sort. At Devcharm we embrace the concept of Open Web and we believe that freely sharing knowledge about programming is at the very root of the progress of the Internet. This said, our goal is to build the first free and open library of curated web references about programming, asking everyone with technical knowledge to contribute. We encourage users to contribute to our articles, but we support the production of content collaborating with experienced editors.

Devcharm will monetize through a Job Board section, offering selected job ads from the best companies in Berlin and Europe to our very specialized audience.
